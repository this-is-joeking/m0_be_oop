# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
> It felt like a fun challenge, going back and accessing the learnings from the rest of the week. I ran out of time so didn't completely solve oop.rb, but will go back later to work on it.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
> Today that is going well I have taken some good breaks which has helped my productivity overall.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
> I need to make sure to have my time blocked off and set reminders for breaks/self care. And have my wife check in with me periodically to keep me accountable on self care.
